			<h1> A little about Jade </h1>
			Jade is currently at Tufts University studying English & Computer Science. Born and bred from Hong Kong, she thinks about its skyline and pineapple buns often, but is starting to accidentally call Boston "home". Jade has worked on several different continents, and can write you pretty much anything from a poem to a computer program. She loves words, kerning, and semi-colons, and is constantly trying to find the intersection of these three realms.
